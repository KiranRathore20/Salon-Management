#Salon-Management-System
The Salon Management System is a microservice-based web application designed to simplify and automate salon operations for administrators, salon owners and customers. It provides secure registration and login with JWT token-based authentication and BCrypt password hashing, along with automated email notifications for registration, bookings and updates. The system separates functionality into dedicated services — user management, salon services, categories, bookings and payments — making it scalable and easy to maintain. Built with a React frontend and a Java Spring Boot backend, it delivers role-based access, a modern user experience and a robust architecture that can be extended to support future features or third-party integrations.
